What is your favorite movie?
One of the best movies I have watched is Interstella by Christopher Nolan
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
It would be Maldives, famous for its beautiful resorts built right above the sea. 
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
A superpower I would want to have is teleportation. With teleportation, I do not have to spend money on plane tickets every time I fly back home in Vietnam to visit my friends and family.
